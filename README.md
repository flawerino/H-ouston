# H-ouston

This project is based on two datasets, both about Veneto; one deals with theaters and the other one with cinemas.
It will allow the user to type the district or the city in which is interested to know the theaters or cinemas present in that place and obtain info about them.
Another function allow the user to see the mean, minimum and maximum regarding the capacity of cinemas in a district.
The last function let the user select a theater and download a file with the informations about it.

### About the datasets

- data.csv
This dataset is about theaters in Veneto, we focused on the districts and the cities for this one, giving back to the user the information contained in the dataset.

- cinema.csv
This second dataset, seen as it is, deals with different recreative places in Veneto, for our functions, we focused only on cinemas, ignoring the others we were not interested in.
Also for this one we focused on district, but then we chose to add another interesting data: the capacity of each cinema.
In this case so, we developed a function that gives back information about cinemas in a chosen district and another function that gives back the mean, minimum and maximum value of capacity of cinemas in a chosen district.

# Flask and FastAPI Dockerized Project

This project demonstrates a simple web application using Flask as the frontend and FastAPI as the backend. The frontend allows querying Veneto's theaters from the backend using a form. The project is Dockerized for easy deployment.

## Architecture

The project follows a simple client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend (Flask):**
   - Represents the user interface or client side.
   - Built with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
   - Responsible for rendering web pages and user interaction, including the form for querying the backend.

2. **Backend (FastAPI):**
   - Represents the server or backend of the application.
   - Built with FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
   - Handles requests from the frontend, including querying birthdays and providing the current date.

3. **Docker Compose:**
   - Orchestrates the deployment of both frontend and backend as separate containers.
   - Ensures seamless communication between frontend and backend containers.
   - Simplifies the deployment and management of the entire application.

### Communication
Bidirectional communication is established between the Frontend (Flask) and Backend (FastAPI). Docker Compose facilitates this communication, allowing the components to work together seamlessly.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI backend implementation.
    - Dockerfile: Dockerfile for building the backend image.
    - main.py: Main backend application file.
    - requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for the backend.
    - .vscode/: folder to launch json
    - mymodules/: folder with functions file
    - data.csv: our csv dataset
    - cinema.csv: our second csv dataset
    - tests/: folder with the file to run the tests
    
- `frontend/`: Flask frontend implementation.
    - Dockerfile: Dockerfile for building the frontend image.
    - templates/: Folder for HTML templates.
    - main.py: Main frontend application file.
    - requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for the frontend.
    - .vscode/: folder to launch json

- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for running both frontend and backend.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Visual Studio Code (Optional, for debugging)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate in the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone REPO_URL
    cd H-ouston
    ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This will start both the frontend and backend containers.
    

3. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the `frontend` and [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to access the `backend`.

4. Use the form on the frontend to query Veneto theaters and cinemas from the backend.

## Shutting Down the Docker Containers

To shut down the running Docker containers, you can use the following steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the project root directory.

3. Run the following command to stop and remove the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Starting and Stopping Containers Individually

If you need to start or stop the containers individually, you can use the following commands:

- **Start Frontend Container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up frontend
    ```

- **Stop Frontend Container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose stop frontend
    ```

- **Start Backend Container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up backend
    ```

- **Stop Backend Container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose stop backend
    ```

Make sure to replace `frontend` and `backend` with the appropriate service names from your `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Notes:

When stopping containers individually, the `docker-compose down` command is not required.
Now you can manage the lifecycle of your Docker containers more flexibly.


## Debugging with Visual Studio Code and Docker Extension

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

2. Set breakpoints in your Python code as needed.

3. Build and run the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    Ensure that your Docker containers are running.

4a. Install the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) for Visual Studio Code.

4b. Install the [Remote Development Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) for Visual Studio Code

5. Open the "Docker" view in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the Docker icon in the Activity Bar.

6. Under "Containers," you should see your running containers. Right-click on the container running your Flask or FastAPI application.

7. Select "Attach Visual Studio Code" from the context menu. This will configure the container for debugging.

8. Open the Run view in Visual Studio Code and select the "Python: Remote Attach" configuration.

9. Click the "Run" button to start the debugger.

10. Access the frontend in your web browser and trigger the actions you want to debug.

### Notes:

- Ensure that your Docker containers are running (`docker-compose up --build`) before attaching Visual Studio Code.

- Adjust the container name in the "Docker: Attach to Node" configuration if needed.

- The provided configurations assume that your Flask or FastAPI application is running with the debugger attached. Adjust the configurations if needed.

- If using Flask, ensure that the Flask application is started with the `--no-reload` option to prevent automatic reloading, which can interfere with debugging.

- Debugging FastAPI requires configuring the FastAPI application to run with the `--reload` option. Update the FastAPI Dockerfile CMD accordingly.

- After the debugger is attached, you can use breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code as needed.


## Adding New Modules to a Running Docker Container

1. **Install Additional Modules:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    pip install python-multipart
    pip install uvicorn
    pip install pandas
    pip install fastapi
    ```

2. **Verify Installed Modules:**
    ```bash
    pip list
    ```
   This command displays a list of installed Python packages, including the newly added modules.

3. **Optional: Update requirements.txt:**
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
   If you want to keep track of the installed modules, you may choose to update the `requirements.txt` file inside the container.


Now, the additional Python modules are installed in the running container, and you've performed these actions directly from the VS Code terminal. If these changes are intended for production, consider updating the `requirements.txt` file and rebuilding the Docker container.
